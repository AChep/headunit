Hello from Canada... :)

See the build_headunit bash script to build from Linux. Edit the first few lines for your environment.

Besides the Android ant build for the Java code, the Android NDK is needed.

Please forgive all the usual transgressions; this code, like all real world code, has plenty of flaws and "character".

Real life coding, trying to solve real problems of people, often requires compromise, and hasty and messy coding is one such.

At this time, I'll mostly blame the fact that I've only put 200 hours or so into coding this app; at least 450 hours were spent doing painstaking reverse engineering, and much more is still needed.

I will fix and re-organize the code a lot, because that's best in the long run.

About me: I've been developing, and building electronics and computer equipment since I became a teen in the mid 1970's, on the first microprocessors, before even assemblers,
hacking "machine language" in binary, hex, or even octal on the front panel switches of the PDP-11/05 that I wire-wrapped and built a 40x12 Unibus display peripheral for.... :)


I'm not too experienced with Git and open source so please excuse related idiosyncracies.

Feel free to share any thoughts to mikereidis@gmail.com or on my Headunit thread on XDA forum: forum.xda-developers.com/general/paid-software/android-4-1-headunit-android-auto-t3125252/


Spirit is my full time job, but I'm sorry to say I still make less than half of my corporate salaries, and work about twice the hours, for the last almost 4 years, from early 2011.

I appreciate the financial support of people buying my apps, Spirit2: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fm.a2d.s2  and the older Spirit1: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mikersmicros.fm_unlock

I am also happy to accept Paypal "donations" to my mikereidis@gmail.com address : https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=mikereidis%40gmail%2ecom&lc=CA&item_name=Spirit%20FM%20%2d%20Mike%20Reid&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted

The commercial Spirit2 has many features that are not in this Spirit2 Free app. As time goes by, I may move paid features to the Free version. The closer I can get to a "normal" salary, the more willing I will be to do so.


Thanks ! :)
Mike Reid.
